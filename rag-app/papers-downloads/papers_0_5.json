[{"title": "Why Quantitative Structuring?", "summary": "Quality-designed consumer products are easy to recognize. Wouldn't it be\ngreat if the quality of financial products became just as apparent? This paper\nis addressed to financial practitioners. It provides an informal introduction\nto Quantitative Structuring -- a technology of manufacturing quality financial\nproducts (information derivatives). The presentation is arranged in three\nparts: the main text assumes no prior knowledge of the topic; important\ndetailed discussions are arranged as a set of appendices; finally, a list of\nreferences provides further details including applications beyond product\ndesign: from model risk to economics and statistics."}, {"title": "Intermittency in Quantitative Finance", "summary": "Factorial moments are convenient tools in nuclear physics to characterize the\nmultiplicity distributions when phase-space resolution ($\\Delta$) becomes\nsmall. For uncorrelated particle production within $\\Delta$, Gaussian\nstatistics holds and factorial moments $F_q$ are equal to unity for all orders\n$q$. Correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity\ndistribution and to dynamical fluctuations. In this case, the factorial moments\nincrease above 1 with decreasing $\\Delta$. This corresponds to what can be\ncalled intermittency. In this letter, we show that a similar analysis can be\ndeveloped on financial price series, with an adequate definition of factorial\nmoments. An intermittent behavior can be extracted using moments of order 2\n($F_2$), illustrating a sensitivity to non-Gaussian fluctuations within time\nresolution below 4 hours. This confirms that correlations between price returns\nstart to play a role when the time resolution is below this threshold."}, {"title": "Exploring Classic Quantitative Strategies", "summary": "The goal of this paper is to debunk and dispel the magic behind the black-box\nquantitative strategies. It aims to build a solid foundation on how and why the\ntechniques work. This manuscript crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from\nsimple intuitions, the mathematics behind the strategies. This tutorial doesn't\nshy away from addressing both the formal and informal aspects of quantitative\nstrategies. By doing so, it hopes to provide readers with a deeper\nunderstanding of these techniques as well as the when, the how and the why of\napplying these techniques. The strategies are presented in terms of both\nS\\&P500 and SH510300 data sets. However, the results from the tests are just\nexamples of how the methods work; no claim is made on the suggestion of real\nmarket positions."}, {"title": "Quantitative analysis of privatization", "summary": "In recent years, the economic policy of privatization, which is defined as\nthe transfer of property or responsibility from public sector to private\nsector, is one of the global phenomenon that increases use of markets to\nallocate resources. One important motivation for privatization is to help\ndevelop factor and product markets, as well as security markets. Progress in\nprivatization is correlated with improvements in perceived political and\ninvestment risk. Many emerging countries have gradually reduced their political\nrisks during the course of sustained privatization. In fact, most risk\nresolution seems to take place as privatization proceeds to its later stage.\nAlternative benefits of privatization are improved risk sharing and increased\nliquidity and activity of the market. One of the main methods to develop\nprivatization is entering a new stock to the markets for arising competition.\nHowever, attention to the capability of the markets to accept a new stock is\nsubstantial. Without considering the above statement, it is possible to reduce\nthe market's efficiency. In other words, introduction of a new stock to the\nmarket usually decreases the stage of development and activity and increases\nthe risk. Based on complexity theory, we quantify how the following factors:\nstage of development, activity, risk and investment horizons play roles in the\nprivatization."}, {"title": "The Elasticity of Quantitative Investment", "summary": "What is the demand elasticity of statistical arbitrageurs that invest\naccording to the advice of modern cross-sectional asset pricing models?\nThirteen models from the literature exhibit strikingly inelastic demand, in\ncontrast to classical models that rely on statistical arbitrageurs to create\nelastic market demand for assets. This inelasticity arises from the difficulty\nof trading against price changes. A quantitative equilibrium model shows that\naggregate demand remains inelastic even with these statistical arbitrageurs in\nthe market."}, {"title": "Risk Measures in Quantitative Finance", "summary": "This paper was presented and written for two seminars: a national UK\nUniversity Risk Conference and a Risk Management industry workshop. The target\naudience is therefore a cross section of Academics and industry professionals.\n  The current ongoing global credit crunch has highlighted the importance of\nrisk measurement in Finance to companies and regulators alike. Despite risk\nmeasurement's central importance to risk management, few papers exist reviewing\nthem or following their evolution from its foremost beginnings up to the\npresent day risk measures.\n  This paper reviews the most important portfolio risk measures in Financial\nMathematics, from Bernoulli (1738) to Markowitz's Portfolio Theory, to the\npresently preferred risk measures such as CVaR (conditional Value at Risk).

This paper aims at providing a comprehensive survey of research efforts\non RL-based methods for QT tasks.

This\nstudy introduces a novel metric, the Ecological Economic Equality Index,\nintegrated with complex network dynamics analysis, to quantitatively evaluate\nthe evolving roles within the global trading network and to pinpoint inequities\nin trade relationships from 1995 to 2022. Utilising high spatiotemporal\nresolution data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-regional Input-output\nmodel, our findings reveal a widening disparity in carbon inequality and\ndynamic patterns.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for data-driven model selection by integrating a classical\nquantitative setup with a generative modelling approach. Leveraging the\nproperties of the signature, a well-known path-transform from stochastic\nanalysis that recently emerged as leading machine learning technology for\nlearning time-series data, we develop the Sig-SDE model. Sig-SDE provides a new\nperspective on neural SDEs and can be calibrated to exotic financial products\nthat depend, in a non-linear way, on the whole trajectory of asset prices.\nFurthermore, we our approach enables to consistently calibrate under the\npricing measure $\\mathbb Q$ and real-world measure $\\mathbb P$. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the ability of Sig-SDE to simulate future possible market scenarios\nneeded for computing risk profiles or hedging strategies. Importantly, this new\nmodel is underpinned by rigorous mathematical analysis, that under appropriate\nconditions provides theoretical guarantees for convergence of the presented\nalgorithms."}, {"title": "Quantum Boltzmann Machines: Applications in Quantitative Finance", "summary": "In this thesis we explore using the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer to\nsample from quantum Boltzmann distributions and train quantum Boltzmann\nmachines (QBMs). We focus on the real-world problem of using QBMs as generative\nmodels to produce synthetic foreign exchange market data and analyze how the\nresults stack up against classical models based on restricted Boltzmann\nmachines (RBMs). Additionally, we study a small 12-qubit problem which we use\nto compare samples obtained from the Advantage 4.1 with theory, and in the\nprocess gain vital insights into how well the Advantage 4.1 can sample quantum\nBoltzmann random variables and be used to train QBMs. Through this, we are able\nto show that the Advantage 4.1 can sample classical Boltzmann random variables\nto some extent, but is limited in its ability to sample from quantum Boltzmann\ndistributions. Our findings indicate that QBMs trained using the Advantage 4.1\nare much noisier than those trained using simulations and struggle to perform\nat the same level as classical RBMs. However, there is the potential for QBMs\nto outperform classical RBMs if future generation annealers can generate\nsamples closer to the desired theoretical distributions."}, {"title": "Christhin: Quantitative Analysis of Thin Layer Chromatography", "summary": "Manual for Christhin 0.1.36 Christhin (Chromatography Riser Thin) is software\ndeveloped for the quantitative analysis of data obtained from thin-layer\nchromatographic techniques (TLC).

These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable\nover different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between\nlevel of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for\ntwo independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between\ncorruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption.\nThe functional relations we report have implications when assessing the\nrelative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for\nquantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign\ninvestments."}, {"title": "Quantitative earnings enhancement from share buybacks", "summary": "This paper aims to explore the mechanical effect of a company's share\nrepurchase on earnings per share (EPS). In particular, while a share repurchase\nscheme will reduce the overall number of shares, suggesting that the EPS may\nincrease, clearly the expenditure will reduce the net earnings of a company,\nintroducing a trade-off between these competing effects. We first of all review\naccretive share repurchases, then characterise the increase in EPS as a\nfunction of price paid by the company. Subsequently, we analyse and quantify\nthe estimated difference in earnings growth between a company's natural growth\nin the absence of buyback scheme to that with its earnings altered as a result\nof the buybacks. We conclude with an examination of the effect of share\nrepurchases in two cases studies in the US stock-market."}, {"title": "Qlib: An AI-oriented Quantitative Investment Platform", "summary": "Quantitative investment aims to maximize the return and minimize the risk in\na sequential trading period over a set of financial instruments.

In markets that admit ``small arbitrage\", we can still make sense of\nthe problems of pricing and hedging. The pricing measures here will be such\nthat asset price processes are close to being martingales, and the hedging\nstrategies will need to cover some additional cost. We show a quantitative\nversion of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and of the\nSuper-Replication Theorem. Finally, we study robustness of the amount of\narbitrage and existence of respective pricing measures, showing stability of\nthese concepts with respect to a strong adapted Wasserstein distance."}, {"title": "Quantitative Trading using Deep Q Learning", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has been\nused in many fields, such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.

By evaluating specific data,\ninvestors can make more informed decisions. However, the current body of\nliterature lacks substantial evidence supporting the practical efficacy of\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents, as many models have only demonstrated\nsuccess in back testing using historical data. This highlights the urgent need\nfor a more advanced methodology capable of addressing these challenges. There\nis a significant disconnect in the effective utilization of financial\nindicators to better understand the potential market trends of individual\nsecurities. The disclosure of successful trading strategies is often restricted\nwithin financial markets, resulting in a scarcity of widely documented and\npublished strategies leveraging RL. Furthermore, current research frequently\noverlooks the identification of financial indicators correlated with various\nmarket trends and their potential advantages.\n  This research endeavors to address these complexities by enhancing the\nability of RL agents to effectively differentiate between positive and negative\nbuy/sell actions using financial indicators.
