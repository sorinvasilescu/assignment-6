[{"title": "Risk Measures in Quantitative Finance", "summary": "This paper was presented and written for two seminars: a national UK\nUniversity Risk Conference and a Risk Management industry workshop. The target\naudience is therefore a cross section of Academics and industry professionals.\n  The current ongoing global credit crunch has highlighted the importance of\nrisk measurement in Finance to companies and regulators alike. Despite risk\nmeasurement's central importance to risk management, few papers exist reviewing\nthem or following their evolution from its foremost beginnings up to the\npresent day risk measures.\n  This paper reviews the most important portfolio risk measures in Financial\nMathematics, from Bernoulli (1738) to Markowitz's Portfolio Theory, to the\npresently preferred risk measures such as CVaR (conditional Value at Risk). We\nprovide a chronological review of the risk measures and survey less commonly\nknown risk measures e.g. Treynor ratio."}, {"title": "The theory of quantitative trading", "summary": "This book consists of a selection of articles divided into three main themes:\nStatistics, Quantitative Trading, Psychology.

In the last\ndecade, reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest in many\ndomains such as robotics and video games, owing to its outstanding ability on\nsolving complex sequential decision making problems. RL's impact is pervasive,\nrecently demonstrating its ability to conquer many challenging QT tasks. It is\na flourishing research direction to explore RL techniques' potential on QT\ntasks. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive survey of research efforts\non RL-based methods for QT tasks. More concretely, we devise a taxonomy of\nRL-based QT models, along with a comprehensive summary of the state of the art.\nFinally, we discuss current challenges and propose future research directions\nin this exciting field."}, {"title": "Quantitative Global Carbon Inequality Network", "summary": "International trading networks significantly influence global economic\nconditions and environmental outcomes. A notable imbalance between economic\ngains and emissions transfers persists, manifesting as carbon inequality. This\nstudy introduces a novel metric, the Ecological Economic Equality Index,\nintegrated with complex network dynamics analysis, to quantitatively evaluate\nthe evolving roles within the global trading network and to pinpoint inequities\nin trade relationships from 1995 to 2022. Utilising high spatiotemporal\nresolution data from the Environmentally Extended Multi-regional Input-output\nmodel, our findings reveal a widening disparity in carbon inequality and\ndynamic patterns. This analysis emphasises the gap in regional carbon\ninequality and identifies unequal trade. The study underscores that carbon\ninequality is a critical challenge affecting both developing and developed\nregions, demanding widespread attention and action."}, {"title": "Sig-SDEs model for quantitative finance", "summary": "Mathematical models, calibrated to data, have become ubiquitous to make key\ndecision processes in modern quantitative finance. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for data-driven model selection by integrating a classical\nquantitative setup with a generative modelling approach. Leveraging the\nproperties of the signature, a well-known path-transform from stochastic\nanalysis that recently emerged as leading machine learning technology for\nlearning time-series data, we develop the Sig-SDE model. Sig-SDE provides a new\nperspective on neural SDEs and can be calibrated to exotic financial products\nthat depend, in a non-linear way, on the whole trajectory of asset prices.\nFurthermore, we our approach enables to consistently calibrate under the\npricing measure $\\mathbb Q$ and real-world measure $\\mathbb P$. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the ability of Sig-SDE to simulate future possible market scenarios\nneeded for computing risk profiles or hedging strategies. Importantly, this new\nmodel is underpinned by rigorous mathematical analysis, that under appropriate\nconditions provides theoretical guarantees for convergence of the presented\nalgorithms."}, {"title": "Quantum Boltzmann Machines: Applications in Quantitative Finance", "summary": "In this thesis we explore using the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer to\nsample from quantum Boltzmann distributions and train quantum Boltzmann\nmachines (QBMs). We focus on the real-world problem of using QBMs as generative\nmodels to produce synthetic foreign exchange market data and analyze how the\nresults stack up against classical models based on restricted Boltzmann\nmachines (RBMs). Additionally, we study a small 12-qubit problem which we use\nto compare samples obtained from the Advantage 4.1 with theory, and in the\nprocess gain vital insights into how well the Advantage 4.1 can sample quantum\nBoltzmann random variables and be used to train QBMs. Through this, we are able\nto show that the Advantage 4.1 can sample classical Boltzmann random variables\nto some extent, but is limited in its ability to sample from quantum Boltzmann\ndistributions. Our findings indicate that QBMs trained using the Advantage 4.1\nare much noisier than those trained using simulations and struggle to perform\nat the same level as classical RBMs. However, there is the potential for QBMs\nto outperform classical RBMs if future generation annealers can generate\nsamples closer to the desired theoretical distributions."}, {"title": "Christhin: Quantitative Analysis of Thin Layer Chromatography", "summary": "Manual for Christhin 0.1.36 Christhin (Chromatography Riser Thin) is software\ndeveloped for the quantitative analysis of data obtained from thin-layer\nchromatographic techniques (TLC).

These relations hold for diverse countries, and also remain stable\nover different time periods. We also observe a negative correlation between\nlevel of corruption and long-term economic growth. We find similar results for\ntwo independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between\ncorruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption.\nThe functional relations we report have implications when assessing the\nrelative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for\nquantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign\ninvestments."}, {"title": "Quantitative earnings enhancement from share buybacks", "summary": "This paper aims to explore the mechanical effect of a company's share\nrepurchase on earnings per share (EPS). In particular, while a share repurchase\nscheme will reduce the overall number of shares, suggesting that the EPS may\nincrease, clearly the expenditure will reduce the net earnings of a company,\nintroducing a trade-off between these competing effects. We first of all review\naccretive share repurchases, then characterise the increase in EPS as a\nfunction of price paid by the company. Subsequently, we analyse and quantify\nthe estimated difference in earnings growth between a company's natural growth\nin the absence of buyback scheme to that with its earnings altered as a result\nof the buybacks. We conclude with an examination of the effect of share\nrepurchases in two cases studies in the US stock-market."}, {"title": "Qlib: An AI-oriented Quantitative Investment Platform", "summary": "Quantitative investment aims to maximize the return and minimize the risk in\na sequential trading period over a set of financial instruments.

In markets that admit ``small arbitrage\", we can still make sense of\nthe problems of pricing and hedging. The pricing measures here will be such\nthat asset price processes are close to being martingales, and the hedging\nstrategies will need to cover some additional cost. We show a quantitative\nversion of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and of the\nSuper-Replication Theorem. Finally, we study robustness of the amount of\narbitrage and existence of respective pricing measures, showing stability of\nthese concepts with respect to a strong adapted Wasserstein distance."}, {"title": "Quantitative Trading using Deep Q Learning", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has been\nused in many fields, such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. There\nhas been growing interest in using RL for quantitative trading, where the goal\nis to make trades that generate profits in financial markets.

The results show that RL can be a useful tool\nfor quantitative trading and can perform better than traditional trading\nalgorithms. The use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading is a\npromising area of research that can help develop more sophisticated and\nefficient trading systems. Future research can explore the use of other\nreinforcement learning techniques, the use of other data sources, and the\ntesting of the system on a range of asset classes.

By evaluating specific data,\ninvestors can make more informed decisions. However, the current body of\nliterature lacks substantial evidence supporting the practical efficacy of\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents, as many models have only demonstrated\nsuccess in back testing using historical data. This highlights the urgent need\nfor a more advanced methodology capable of addressing these challenges. There\nis a significant disconnect in the effective utilization of financial\nindicators to better understand the potential market trends of individual\nsecurities. The disclosure of successful trading strategies is often restricted\nwithin financial markets, resulting in a scarcity of widely documented and\npublished strategies leveraging RL. Furthermore, current research frequently\noverlooks the identification of financial indicators correlated with various\nmarket trends and their potential advantages.\n  This research endeavors to address these complexities by enhancing the\nability of RL agents to effectively differentiate between positive and negative\nbuy/sell actions using financial indicators. While we do not address all\nconcerns, this paper provides deeper insights and commentary on the utilization\nof technical indicators and their benefits within reinforcement learning.
