[{"title": "Quantitative Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing", "summary": "In this paper we provide a quantitative analysis to the concept of arbitrage,\nthat allows to deal with model uncertainty without imposing the no-arbitrage\ncondition. In markets that admit ``small arbitrage\", we can still make sense of\nthe problems of pricing and hedging. The pricing measures here will be such\nthat asset price processes are close to being martingales, and the hedging\nstrategies will need to cover some additional cost. We show a quantitative\nversion of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and of the\nSuper-Replication Theorem. Finally, we study robustness of the amount of\narbitrage and existence of respective pricing measures, showing stability of\nthese concepts with respect to a strong adapted Wasserstein distance."}, {"title": "Quantitative Trading using Deep Q Learning", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has been\nused in many fields, such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. There\nhas been growing interest in using RL for quantitative trading, where the goal\nis to make trades that generate profits in financial markets. This paper\npresents the use of RL for quantitative trading and reports a case study based\non an RL-based trading algorithm. The results show that RL can be a useful tool\nfor quantitative trading and can perform better than traditional trading\nalgorithms. The use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading is a\npromising area of research that can help develop more sophisticated and\nefficient trading systems. Future research can explore the use of other\nreinforcement learning techniques, the use of other data sources, and the\ntesting of the system on a range of asset classes. Together, our work shows the\npotential in the use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading and the\nneed for further research and development in this area.

By evaluating specific data,\ninvestors can make more informed decisions. However, the current body of\nliterature lacks substantial evidence supporting the practical efficacy of\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents, as many models have only demonstrated\nsuccess in back testing using historical data. This highlights the urgent need\nfor a more advanced methodology capable of addressing these challenges. There\nis a significant disconnect in the effective utilization of financial\nindicators to better understand the potential market trends of individual\nsecurities. The disclosure of successful trading strategies is often restricted\nwithin financial markets, resulting in a scarcity of widely documented and\npublished strategies leveraging RL. Furthermore, current research frequently\noverlooks the identification of financial indicators correlated with various\nmarket trends and their potential advantages.\n  This research endeavors to address these complexities by enhancing the\nability of RL agents to effectively differentiate between positive and negative\nbuy/sell actions using financial indicators. While we do not address all\nconcerns, this paper provides deeper insights and commentary on the utilization\nof technical indicators and their benefits within reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we first\nshow through simulation that if we could select stocks via factors calculated\non future fundamentals (via oracle), that our portfolios would far outperform\nstandard factor models. Motivated by this insight, we train deep nets to\nforecast future fundamentals from a trailing 5-year history.

Collectively,\nthese tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse\nfinancial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an\nin-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and\ncontrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models.

Series fluctuating according to a qGaussian\ndistribution, both uncorrelated and correlated in time, are used. For the\nuncorrelated series at the border (q=5/3) between the Gaussian and the Levy\nbasins of attraction asymptotically we find a phase-like transition between\nmonofractal and bifractal characteristics. This indicates that these may solely\nbe the specific nonlinear temporal correlations that organize the series into a\ngenuine multifractal hierarchy. For analyzing various features of\nmultifractality due to such correlations, we use the model series generated\nfrom the binomial cascade as well as empirical series. Then, within the\ntemporal ranges of well developed power-law correlations we find a fast\nconvergence in all multifractal measures.

Many of the\nreviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in\nunrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications.
